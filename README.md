# Telegram Speech-to-Text Bot

This Telegram bot is designed to generate text from speech. Users can send voice messages to the bot, and it will convert the audio into text, providing users with a written transcription of the spoken content. The bot leverages the power of speech recognition services to achieve this functionality.
The main motive behind creating this bot is to enhance accessibility and improve communication for users who prefer reading text over listening to audio messages. By providing an automated way to transcribe voice messages into text, this bot aims to make communication more inclusive and convenient for all users.

## Features

1. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Users can send voice messages to the bot, and it will use a Speech-to-Text service to convert the audio into text.

2. **Real-time Transcription**: The bot generates text from the voice message in real-time and responds with the transcribed text shortly after the message is received.

3. **Multi-language Support**: The Speech-to-Text service used by the bot supports multiple languages, enabling users to transcribe voice messages in various languages.

4. **Accurate Transcription**: The bot aims to provide accurate and reliable transcriptions, but the accuracy may vary based on the quality of the audio and the performance of the underlying Speech-to-Text service.

## Getting Started

7. Run the bot using the following command:
      ```python
      python bot.py
      ```

## Usage

Once the bot is up and running, users can interact with it in the following way:

2. The bot will process the voice message using the configured Speech-to-Text service and respond with the transcribed text.

## Bot Commands and Their Working

The Telegram Speech-to-Text Bot supports the following commands and functionalities:

1. `/start`: The `/start` command initiates the bot and displays a welcome message to the user.

2. `/help`: The `/help` command provides a brief explanation of how to use the bot and lists available commands.

3. `/link <URL>`: The `/link` command allows users to download a file from a given link. Replace `<URL>` with a valid URL. The bot will download the file and send it as a document to the chat.

4. `/makefile`: The `/makefile` command enables "File Make Mode." In this mode, users can create a text file by sending a series of text messages. The first line of the text will be taken as the file name, and the subsequent text will be saved as the file content. Once the file is created, the bot will send it as a document to the chat.

5. `/cancel`: The `/cancel` command cancels the "File Make Mode" if it is enabled, allowing the user to abort the file creation process.
